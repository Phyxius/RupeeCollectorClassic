#Rupee Collector Classic
A remix of Rupee Collector I made in a weekend for Chris Holden's Local Games class in Fall 2015. 

This game uses [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/), a free game engine that uses Lua for scripting.
#Running
##Windows
Download a copy of `Rupee Collector Classic.exe` and run it.
##Mac OS X
Download a copy of `Rupee Collector Classic.app.zip`, unzip it, and run it.
**Note:** OS X is untested, as I do not own a Mac.
##Linux
Download a copy of LÖVE from your distribution's package manager or their website, then download a copy of `Rupee Collector Classic.love` and open it in LÖVE.
